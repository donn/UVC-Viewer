# UVC Viewer
These are various implementations of UVC loopback applications for all three major platforms.

The idea is it would allow you to use your computer as kind of a viewfinder for a UVC-compatible video device, and also play back audio.

There are three implementations:
* Windows/UWP: I'm pretty happy with this one
* Mac/Cocoa: It works fine but the latency is untenable
* Linux/libuvc+opencv: This one sucks
